# About
The focus of this project is to utilize the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org) in order to create a Flutter App with 2 screens. The first screen will display the current weather for the cities listed below:

- Silverstone, UK
- SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil
- Melbourne, Australia
- Monte Carlo, Monaco

The second screen will provide a 5-day forecast when you click on a city.

# Specs

### App
- Compatible with Android and iOS
- Functional offline
- Supports multiple resolutions and screen sizes

### First Screen
- The list of cities should display their names
- Search field at the top
- Current weather at the bottom of the screen

# Getting Started

- This project uses Flutter version 3.10.1
- It is currently operational on both the Web and Android platforms

If you are using Visual Studio Code, there is a configured `launch.json` named "open_weather_app" to run the app.

If you prefer using Android Studio, you will need the following environment variables:

```yaml
  "--dart-define=BASE_URL=http://api.openweathermap.org",
  "--dart-define=APPID=f551d279b4f5f635ca525c6024fcdc26"
```

You can also run unit tests:

```
flutter test
```

Disclaimer: I've included this APPID here for testing convenience, but I don't recommend doing this in a production environment.
